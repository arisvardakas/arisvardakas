Creator of [Fixyfier](https://fixyfier.com), available on the [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9pp0m68r9b04) — a unified tool for repairing, optimizing, and diagnosing Windows systems.

I write code, test edge cases I probably shouldn't, and occasionally convince electrons to behave. Welcome!
